## Description
A weather app built with **React.js** and **Webpack** that uses the [Open Weather API](http://openweathermap.org/api "Open Weather API") to display the weather forecast of any city within the next five days.

## Notes
This project currently does not have a demo. I tried to host it on gh-pages, but the weather API this project makes a request to only uses HTTP while gh-pages enforces HTTPS. I'll be looking for other hosting services so I can get a demo running. In the meantime, feel free to follow the instructions below to view this project.
